			 "question": "Four friends need to cross a dangerous bridge at night. Unfortunately, they have only one torch and the bridge is too dangerous to cross without one. The bridge is only strong enough to support two people at a time. Not all people take the same time to cross the bridge. Times for each person: 1 min, 2 mins, 7 mins and 10 mins. What is the shortest time needed for all four of them to cross the bridge?",
			 "answer": "17 mins The initial solution most people will think of is to use the fastest person as an usher to guide everyone across. How long would that take? 10 + 1 + 7 + 1 + 2 = 21 mins. Is that it? No. That would make this question too simple even as a warm up question. Let’s brainstorm a little further. To reduce the amount of time, we should find a way for 10 and 7 to go together. If they cross together, then we need one of them to come back to get the others. That would not be ideal. How do we get around that? Maybe we can have 1 waiting on the other side to bring the torch back. Ahaa, we are getting closer. The fastest way to get 1 across and be back is to use 2 to usher 1 across. So let’s put all this together.1 and 2 go cross 2 comes back 7 and 10 go across 1 comes back 1 and 2 go across (done)Total time = 2 + 2 + 10 + 1 + 2 = 17 mins",

On being asked by the parents, the child forms an innocent face and blurts out the following:There is not enough time to attend the school for me. Doctors say that a child must sleep for eight hours every day and so I sleep for 122 days a year (8 hours each day for 365 days). The weekends are officially off and thus in a year, the school remains shut for 104 days. The school gives us 60 days of summer holidays off every year. I chew my food adequately and thus it takes me an hour for each meal adding to 3 hours every day or 45 days in a year. For keeping me physically and mentally fit, I spend 2 hours daily in exercise and recreational activities which adds to 30 days a year. If you add all these days, you will get 361 days and thus I am left with just 4 days to attend the school.The parents and principal are baffled by hearing it. Where do you think the child is miscalculating as this is certainly not feasible?",

The weekend are present in the summer holidays as well. Then the school last maximum for 6 hours and in that case, even the 4 days that remains will comprise of at least 16 school days. In the similar fashion, the weekends off are not entirely to be excluded but only 6 hours each day to be excluded. If you calculate gain, you will be left with so many more days/hours.",

			 "question": "There were once 3 brothers, one day on the way to their grandmothers funeral their car broke down.Oh great, they all thought, and tried to fix the car but finally decided they had no idea what they were doing.The middle and youngest brother teamed up and forced the eldest to walk in search of a house where they could use a telephone to call a local tow truck.They were literally stranded out in the middle of nowhere-the landscape was barren and nondescript.The eldest brother walked for ages until suddenly he appeared before a large Victorian home. Everything was pink.Thinking that this was a little strange, the brother peered down the road for possible neighbors, but he could see nothing at all.The picket fence lining the yard was pink, as was the gate. The path to the house was pink, the porch was pink. The door was pink. The shudders were pink. EVERYTHING was pink.He opened up the fence gate which screeched 'Piiiinnnkkk!!' as he walked the path his footsteps barked 'Pi-Pink Pi-Pink P-Pink!!'. As he walked the porch steps they groaned 'PPPink PPPink PPPink!!'Finally, with many 'Pink' statements he made it to the door and knocked loudly, the door shouted back 'PINK PINK'He waited a minute or two but no one answered the door. He decided it was best to go inside anyway, they still needed to make a phone call. He grabbed the doorknob and turned it- it whispered softly 'ppinkkk'.He shouted into the home 'Hello? Im just here to use your phone!'When he looked around the home, once again everything was pink. Pink furniture, Pink carpeting, Pink drapes, Pink walls.He figured the phone was in the kitchen so he walked in there, pink tile, pink cupboards, pink fridge, pink everything.He heard his stomach growl and decided to steal some food, plus the phone call could wait. When he opened the pantry there sat Bread Brand and Rice Flakes. He chose the Rice Flakes and ate it happily.Back at the stranded car, the two brothers became angry, they both decided to search for their brother and for a phone. They walked for what seemed hours and soon discovered the giant pink house and figured their brother had gone there, as there was no other neighbors.The picket fence lining the yard was pink, as was the gate. The path to the house was pink, the porch was pink. The door was pink. The shudders were pink. EVERYTHING was pink.They opened up the fence gate which screeched 'Piiiinnnkkk!!' as they walked the path their footsteps barked 'Pi-Pink Pi-Pink P-Pink!!'. As they walked the porch steps they groaned 'PPPink PPPink PPPink!!'Finally, with many 'Pink' statements they made it to the door and knocked loudly, the door shouted back 'PINK PINK'They waited a minute or two but no one answered the door. They decided it was best to go inside anyway, they still needed to make a phone call. One brother grabbed the doorknob and turned it- it whispered softly 'ppinkkk'.The other brother shouted into the home 'Hello? We're just here to use your phone!'When they looked around the home, once again everything was pink. Pink furniture, Pink carpeting, Pink drapes, Pink walls.They figured the phone was in the kitchen so they walked in there, pink tile, pink cupboards, pink fridge, pink everything.The brothers both heard their stomachs growl and decided to steal some food, plus the phone call could wait.

'I sold him the well but not the water!'?The Emperor asked Birbal to settle the dispute.How did Birbal solve the dispute?",
			 "answer": "'Didn't you say that you sold your well to this farmer?' Birbal asked the neighbour. 'So, the well belongs to him now, but you have kept your water in his well. Is that right? Well, in that case you will have to pay him a rent or take your water out at once.'The neighbour realized that he was outwitted. He quickly apologised and gave up his claim.",
